Contains all files for my final project for MPCS 53112, Advanced Data Analytics with Amitabh Chaudhary. 

Code is an implementation of an algorithm for persitence homology, plus material for testing. "homology.py" contains the algorithm itself, along with helper methods as well as post and pre-processing functions. "test_shape.py" contains code to produce shapes with which to test the algorithm. "test.ipynb" contains a few tests of the code with brief commentary. 

Presentations includes slides for two in-class presentations for this project.

This repo also contains my final report for the project, which includes detailed explanation of the code and necessary theoretical exposition.

Enjoy.
